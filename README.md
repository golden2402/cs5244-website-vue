# Bookmart (Vue)

This is a semester-long project I created for an undisclosed class at Virginia Tech. It is an eCommerce-like website written in Vue that had a backend supported by Jakarta EE (course choice), that I designed in Figma and implemented from scratch.

I have chosen not to include the Jakarta EE backend because much of it was fill-in-the-blank template work&mdash;it doesn't reflect any of my personal ability.
